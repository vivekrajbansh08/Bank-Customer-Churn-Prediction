# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction

# Problem Statement :
Customer churn or customer attrition is a tendency of clients or customers to abandon a brand and stop being a paying client of a particular business or organization. The percentage of customers that discontinue using a company’s services or products during a specific period is called a customer churn rate. Several bad experiences (or just one) are enough, and a customer may quit. And if a large chunk of unsatisfied customers churn at a time interval, both material losses and damage to reputation would be enormous.

A reputed bank “ABC BANK” wants to predict the Churn rate. Create a model by using different machine learning approaches that can predict the best result.

# Dataset Description :
This is a public dataset, The dataset format is given below.

Inside the dataset, there are 10000 rows and 14 different columns.

The target column here is Exited here.

# Working Flow :
In order to create a model these are the following procedure -

Split the dataset in 80% of Train set and 20% of Test Set
Feature engineering
Check the accuracy score for both Training and Test Set
Compare the accuracies for both Training and Test set, in order to check for the overfitting issues
